# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions for Master Universe Almanac

Please follow these guidelines when generating code for this project:

- The project involves modernizing the Master Universe Almanac, a reference work for the Urantia Book, with a focus on readability, responsiveness, and ease of use for students.
- Use React functional components along with Next.js to build web pages, ensuring that components are modular and reusable.
- Emphasize a responsive design that works seamlessly on desktops, Android phones, and iPads. Implement techniques such as lazy loading, code splitting, and server-side rendering whenever applicable.
- For long-scroll pages displaying large datasets or multi-column tables, break content into modular sections or cards. Ensure tables allow horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.
- Implement navigation features such as a left-top-floating hamburger menu for quick internal links and a floating settings icon for dark/light mode toggling (defaulting to dark mode) and progressive font size adjustments.
- Follow our specific coding style: use double quotes for JavaScript code, tabs for indentation, and include inline comments where appropriate—mark auto-generated code with a comment like “Generated by Copilot.”
- Write code that is optimized for our deployment environment (Vercel) and integrates smoothly with our development workflow using VS Code and GitHub.
- Maintain high standards of accessibility by using proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and ensuring keyboard navigation where applicable.
- Incorporate Material Design elements into the UI/UX design, unless advised otherwise.
